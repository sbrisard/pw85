  abstract = {In this first part of a series of two papers, we present in considerable detail a collision-driven molecular dynamics algorithm for a system of non-spherical particles, within a parallelepiped simulation domain, under both periodic or hard-wall boundary conditions. The algorithm extends previous event-driven molecular dynamics algorithms for spheres, and is most efficient when applied to systems of particles with relatively small aspect ratios and with small variations in size. We present a novel partial-update near-neighbor list (NNL) algorithm that is superior to previous algorithms at high densities, without compromising the correctness of the algorithm. This efficiency of the algorithm is further increased for systems of very aspherical particles by using bounding sphere complexes (BSC). These techniques will be useful in any particle-based simulation, including Monte Carlo and time-driven molecular dynamics. Additionally, we allow for a non-vanishing rate of deformation of the boundary, which can be used to model macroscopic strain and also alleviate boundary effects for small systems. In the second part of this series of papers we specialize the algorithm to systems of ellipses and ellipsoids and present performance results for our implementation, demonstrating the practical utility of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {A contact function for two arbitrary ellipsoids is derived. The numerical value of the contact function is less than 1 if they overlap, and greater than 1 if they do not. This extends previous work by Vieillard-Baron, who derived an overlap criterion for spheroids without use of a contact function. The equivalence of the two criteria has been checked by extensive numerical test with spheroids. It is shown that the use of the contact function greatly facilitates the calculation of the pressure in Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {We apply the algorithm presented in the first part of this series of papers to systems of hard ellipses and ellipsoids. The theoretical machinery needed to treat such particles, including the overlap potentials, is developed in full detail. We describe an algorithm for predicting the time of collision for two moving ellipses or ellipsoids. We present performance results for our implementation of the algorithm, demonstrating that for dense systems of very aspherical ellipsoids the novel techniques of using neighbor lists and bounding sphere complexes, offer as much as two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency over direct adaptations of traditional event-driven molecular dynamics algorithms. The practical utility of the algorithm is demonstrated by presenting several interesting physical applications, including the generation of jammed packings inside spherical containers, the study of contact force chains in jammed packings, and melting the densest-known equilibrium crystals of prolate spheroids.},

  abstract = {By Monte Carlo calculations in the canonical ensemble, we have studied some properties of a two-dimensional system of 170 long hard ellipses (whose axis ratio equals 6). This system can be considered as a two-dimensional model for a nematic liquid crystal. We have shown that this system exhibits two first-order phase transitions: a solid-nematic type phase transition at high density and a disorientation phase transition at a density 1.5 times smaller. This result suggests that excluded volume effects might play an essential role in the disorientation phase transition of nematic liquid crystals.},

  shorttitle = {Small-Angle Scattering of Dense, Polydisperse Granular Porous Media},
  abstract = {Small-angle x-ray and neutrons scattering is a widespread experimental tool for the investigation of the microstructure of random heterogeneous materials. Validation of (computer-generated) model microstructures often requires the numerical computation of the scattering intensity, which must be carried out with great care due to finite size effects. In this paper, a new method for this computation is presented. It is superior to previously existing methods for three reasons: First, it applies to any type of microstructure (not necessarily granular). Second, closed-form expressions of the size effects inherent to the proposed method can be rigorously derived and removed (in this sense, our method is free of size effects). Third, the complexity of the new algorithm is linear and the computation can easily be updated to account for local changes of the microstructure, while most existing algorithms are quadratic and any change of the microstructure requires a full recomputation. The present paper provides full derivation and validation of this method. Application to the computation of the scattering intensity of dense, polydisperse assemblies of spheres is then presented. A new, simple algorithm for the generation of these dense configurations is introduced. Finally, the results are critically reviewed in the perspective of hardened cement pastes.},

  volume = {210},
  issn = {0045-7949},
  abstract = {This work proposes an extension of the well-known random sequential adsorption (RSA) method in the context of non-overlapping random mono- and polydisperse ellipsoidal inclusions. The algorithm is general and can deal with inclusions of different size, shape and orientation with or without periodic geometrical constraints. Specifically, polydisperse inclusions, which can be in terms of different size, shape, orientation or even material properties, allow for larger volume fractions without the need of additional changes in the main algorithm. Unit-cell computations are performed by using either the fast Fourier transformed-based numerical scheme (FFT) or the finite element method (FEM) to estimate the effective elastic properties of voided particulate microstructures. We observe that an isotropic overall response is very difficult to obtain for random distributions of spheroidal inclusions with high aspect ratio. In particular, a substantial increase (or decrease) of the aspect ratio of the voids leads to a markedly anisotropic response of the porous material, which is intrinsic of the RSA construction. The numerical estimates are probed by analytical Hashin-Shtrikman-Willis (HSW) estimates and bounds.},
