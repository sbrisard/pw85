# Introduction

It is quite common in materials science to reason on assemblies of ellipsoids as
model materials. Although simplified upscaling mean-field/effective-field
theories exist for such microstructures, they often fail to capture the finest
details of the microstructure, such as orientation correlations between
anisotropic inclusions, or particle-size distributions. In order to account for
such microstructural details, one must resort to so-called *full-field*
numerical simulations (using dedicated tools such as janus, for example).

Full-field simulations require realizations of the microstructure. If the
microstructure under investigation is made of ellipsoidal inclusions, it is
therefore necessary to be able to generate assemblies of (non-overlapping)
ellipsoids. The basic ingredient of such microstructure simulations is of course
the overlap test of two inclusions.

Checking for the overlap (or the absence of it) of two ellipsoids is not as
trivial as checking for the overlap of two spheres. Several criteria have been
published.
