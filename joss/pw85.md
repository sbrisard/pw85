# Introduction

It is quite common in materials science to reason on assemblies of ellipsoids as
model materials. Although simplified upscaling mean-field/effective-field
theories exist for such microstructures, they often fail to capture the finest
details of the microstructure, such as orientation correlations between
anisotropic inclusions, or particle-size distributions. In order to account for
such microstructural details, one must resort to so-called *full-field*
numerical simulations (using dedicated tools such as [Damask][damask] or
[Janus][janus], for example).

Full-field simulations require *realizations* of the microstructure. For
composites made of ellipsoidal inclusions embedded in a (homogeneous) matrix,
this requires to be able to generate assemblies of (non-overlapping)
ellipsoids. The basic ingredient of such microstructure simulations is of course
the overlap test of two inclusions.

Checking for the overlap (or the absence of it) of two ellipsoids is not as
trivial as checking for the overlap of two spheres. Several criteria can be
found in the literature [@viei1972; @perr1985; @wang2001; @chen2007;
@anou2018]. We require the overlap criterion to be implemented to be *robust*
and to somehow *quantify the “closeness”* of the two ellipsoids under
consideration. These two requirements are discussed below.

Robustness of the overlap criterion refers to floating-point errors. Indeed, all
overlap checks amount to checking for the sign of a real quantity $\Phi(\mathcal
E_1, \mathcal E_2)$ that depends on the two ellipsoids $\mathcal E_i$ ($i=1,
2$). The ellipsoids do not overlap when $\Phi(\mathcal E_1, \mathcal E_2)<0$;
they do overlap when $\Phi(\mathcal E_1, \mathcal E_2)>0$. Finally, we usually
have $\Phi(\mathcal E_1, \mathcal E_2)=0$ when $\mathcal E_1$ and $\mathcal E_2$
are in tangent contact (but it is important to note that, depending on the
overlap crtiterion, the converse is not necessarily true).

In a finite precision setting, we are bound to make wrong decisions about pairs
of ellipsoids that are such that $\Phi$ is small. Indeed, let us consider a pair
of ellipsoids for which the true value of $\Phi$ is close to the machine
epsilon. Then accumulation of round-off errors could equally well result in the
numerical estimate of $\Phi$ to be positive or negative. In other words, we will
encounter pairs of ellipsoids that really do not overlap but still are rejected,
while we will keep other pairs of ellipsoids that truly overlap. This is
acceptable (and the overlap criterion will be considered as robust) if these
misclassifications occur for ellipsoids that are very close (nearly in tangent
contact).
