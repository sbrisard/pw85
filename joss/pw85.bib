  abstract = {A contact function for two arbitrary ellipsoids is derived. The numerical value of the contact function is less than 1 if they overlap, and greater than 1 if they do not. This extends previous work by Vieillard-Baron, who derived an overlap criterion for spheroids without use of a contact function. The equivalence of the two criteria has been checked by extensive numerical test with spheroids. It is shown that the use of the contact function greatly facilitates the calculation of the pressure in Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {Small-angle x-ray and neutrons scattering is a widespread experimental tool for the investigation of the microstructure of random heterogeneous materials. Validation of (computer-generated) model microstructures often requires the numerical computation of the scattering intensity, which must be carried out with great care due to finite size effects. In this paper, a new method for this computation is presented. It is superior to previously existing methods for three reasons: First, it applies to any type of microstructure (not necessarily granular). Second, closed-form expressions of the size effects inherent to the proposed method can be rigorously derived and removed (in this sense, our method is free of size effects). Third, the complexity of the new algorithm is linear and the computation can easily be updated to account for local changes of the microstructure, while most existing algorithms are quadratic and any change of the microstructure requires a full recomputation. The present paper provides full derivation and validation of this method. Application to the computation of the scattering intensity of dense, polydisperse assemblies of spheres is then presented. A new, simple algorithm for the generation of these dense configurations is introduced. Finally, the results are critically reviewed in the perspective of hardened cement pastes.},
