"Compute the quadratic form associated to a spheroid.\n"
"\n"
"The spheroid is defined by its equatorial radius ``a``, its polar radius ``c``\n"
"and the direction of its axis of revolution, ``n`` (unit-vector, ``double[3]``\n"
"array).\n"
"\n"
"``q`` is the representation of a symmetric matrix as a ``double[6]`` array. It\n"
"is modified in-place.\n"
