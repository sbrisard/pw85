This chapter describes how to install the C library as well as the
Python bindings. The first step is to clone the source of this
library. You can either get the latest release at
https://github.com/sbrisard/pw85/releases or clone the Git repository
for the development version::

  git clone


Building and installing the C library
=====================================

PW85 requires a POSIX system. On Windows platforms, it is recommended that you
install `MSYS2 <https://www.msys2.org/The>`_.

.. note:: Meson supports MSVC compilers. However, at the time of writing,
          MSVC-based installation has not been tested. Contributions are most
          welcome!


The installation procedure also requires Python 3.

For installation, we use the `Meson build system
<https://mesonbuild.com/>`_. We assume that GLib, GSL and Meson are installed
on your system. Assuming that the project is built in the ``src/build/``
directory (no need to create it first), here is the whole installation
procedure (you must first ``cd`` into the root directory of the PW85 project)::

  cd pw85/src
  meson build
  cd build
  ninja install

A prefix can be specified in order for PW85 to be installed in a custom
directory, like so::

  cd pw85/src
  meson build --prefix=C:/opt/pw85
  cd build
  ninja install

Congratulations, ``PW85`` is now built and installed! You can then test the
installation (stay in the ``src/build`` directory)::

  meson test


If you also intend to link the library to e.g. C executables, you must inform
your system about the location of the library.

- On Windows platforms, you need to add the full path to ``pw85.dll`` to your
  ``PATH`` environment variable.
- On Linux or MacOS platforms, no further operation is required.
