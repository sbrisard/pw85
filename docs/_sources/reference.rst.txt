This chapter provides some references to the algorithm. We use
matrices rather than tensors: a point or a vector are therefore
defined through the column-vector of their coordinates. Likewise, a
second-rank tensor is represented by its 3×3 matrix.

Only the global, cartesian frame is considered here, and there is no
ambiguity about the basis to which these column vectors and square
matrices refer.


Mathematical definition of ellipsoids – Implementation in ``PW85``
==================================================================

Ellipsoids are defined from their center ``c`` and a positive-definite
quadratic form ``Q`` as the set of points ``m`` such that::

    (m-c)ᵀ⋅Q⋅(m-c) ≤ 1.

``Q`` is a symmetric, positive-definite matrix. In the ``PQ85``, it is
represented as a ``double[6]`` array ``q`` which stores the upper
triangular part of ``Q`` in row-major order::


    Q = ⎡ q[0] q[1] q[2] ⎤
        ⎢      q[3] q[4] ⎥
	⎣ sym.      q[5] ⎦
