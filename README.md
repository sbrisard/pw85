# PW85

Overlap test of two ellipsoids.

PW85 provides a C implementation of the “contact function” defined by
Perram and Wertheim (J. Comp. Phys. 58(3), 409–416,
[DOI:10.1016/0021-9991(85)90171-8][doi]) for two ellipsoids. Given two
ellipsoids, this function returns the *square* of the common factor by
which both ellipsoids must be scaled (their centers being fixed) in
order to be tangentially in contact.

PW85 is released under a BSD 3-Clause License.
