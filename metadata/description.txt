Overlap test of two ellipsoids.

PW85 provides an implementation of the “contact function”
defined by Perram and Wertheim (J. Comp. Phys. 58(3), 409–416) for two
ellipsoids. Given two ellipsoids, this function returns the *square*
of the common factor by which both ellipsoids must be scaled (their
centers being fixed) in order to be tangentially in contact.

PW85 is released under a BSD 3-Clause License.
